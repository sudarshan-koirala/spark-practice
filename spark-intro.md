## Introduction to Spark and related stuffs
1. Spark is built on top of Scala Programming Language which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
2. As a python guy, to run programs we need Python API for Spark -> [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/)
3. PySpark is built on top of Spark's Java API so JDK is needed to run the programs.

Some useful commands to know, 
```
java -version
git --version
pyspark
```
